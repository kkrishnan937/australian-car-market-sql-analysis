# 🚗 Australian Car Dataset – SQL Insights  

---

## 📊 Introduction  
This project analyzes the **Australian Car Dataset** using **MySQL**, with the goal of **generating insights** that help automakers, dealerships, and buyers understand 💰 pricing trends, 🏆 brand performance, and 📈 market opportunities.  

🔍 SQL queries? Check them out in the [`Queries/`](Queries) folder.

## 🗂️ Background  
The dataset includes information such as **brand, model, year, kilometers, price, type, and fuel type**.  
With SQL, I explored questions like:  

- What are the **top 5 most expensive cars**?  
- How many **modern cars (after 2015)** does each brand have?  
- What’s the **fuel type distribution**?  
- Which brands **command premium pricing**?  
- Which brands maintain **high resale value**?  
- What cars provide the **best overall value**?

## ⚙️ Tools I Used  
- 🛢️ **MySQL** → data analysis & queries  
- 💻 **Visual Studio Code** → query execution  
- 🗂️ **Git & GitHub** → version control & project sharing  
- 📊 *(Planned)* Power BI → dashboard visualization
